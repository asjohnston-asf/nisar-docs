# Finding NISAR Data with Vertex Data Search

# Vertex Data Search

[Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) was developed by ASF to facilitate search and discovery for NASA's SAR datasets. Refer to the [Vertex User Manual](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/manual/) for more guidance on search capabilities. 

## Using Vertex to Access NISAR Data

To search for NISAR datasets specifically, select `NISAR` from the **Dataset** menu. Click the **Filters** button to expose additional parameters that can be used to narrow your search.

Because search parameters of interest for SAR differ from other types of Earth observation data, it can be helpful to use a platform that is tailored to the parameters and characteristics of SAR data. This is particularly useful for those who are less familiar with SAR data products and may need more guidance to find the appropriate dataset for their use case.

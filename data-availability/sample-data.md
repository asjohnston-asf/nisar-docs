## NISAR Sample Data: January 2026

NISAR mission data was processed to generate products from Level-1 to Level-3. These datasets are available for a range of geographic locations, and give users a first look at products generated from NISAR acquisitions. These sample products are a preview for a larger global product release of sample products, expected in March 2026. 

The NISAR project is still in the early phases of calibration, so these products are not yet fully calibrated, and contain artifacts. The products will be improved in future product releases, but these sample products allow users to become familiar with NISAR data products and develop methods for working with the data and metadata.

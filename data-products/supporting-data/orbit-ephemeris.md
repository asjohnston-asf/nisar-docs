## Orbit Ephemeris Overview

NISAR Orbit Ephemeris (OE) products describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of the NISAR satellite through time. Accurate ephemeris measurements are essential for focusing, mapping, and geolocating SAR imagery, and are often used as input to SAR processing workflows.

## Orbit Ephemeris Datasets

Satellite position and velocity can be predicted in advance with reasonable accuracy. Position and velocity measured at the time of acquisition yield improved accuracy and precision. Accuracy and precision can be further improved after the time of acquisition by incorporating additional GNSS data.

Four types of Orbit Ephemeris products are provided for NISAR reflecting this trade-off between latency and quality:

1. Forecast Orbit Ephemeris (FOE)
2. Near real-time Orbit Ephemeris (NOE)
3. Medium precision Orbit Ephemeris (MOE)
4. Precise Orbit Ephemeris (POE)

FOE products are the earliest available and lowest data quality, while POE products are the latest available and highest data quality. The characteristics of these datasets are described in @tbl:nisar-orbit-ephemeris-characteristics.

## Orbit Ephemeris File Contents

Each OE product is an XML file containing a list of position, velocity, and acceleration vectors at regular time intervals. A full description of the XML structure and data values will be made available in a future Product Specification document.
